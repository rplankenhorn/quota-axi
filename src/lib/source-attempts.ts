 * exceptions.
 *
 * - `isUncertainSkip`: a skip the adapter reads as establishing nothing either
 *   way (Copilot's CLI configuration that names no confirmable account, an
 *   installed Antigravity CLI that timed out) keeps the provider in view.
 * - `incidentalSources`: a sibling tool's login is not evidence of this
 *   provider (a GitHub CLI login is not Copilot access), so a skip there that
 *   read the store, or a request through it that was definitively refused,
 *   counts as absence. A store that could not be read, or a request that
 *   failed transiently, proves nothing and keeps the provider in view.
